Basic PHP Questions:
What is PHP and what are its common uses?

PHP is a server-side scripting language used primarily for web development to create dynamic web pages.
Explain the difference between echo and print in PHP.

echo can output multiple strings and has no return value, while print can only output one string and returns 1, allowing it to be used in expressions.
What are the differences between GET and POST methods in form submission?

GET appends form data to the URL, suitable for non-sensitive data and has length limitations. POST sends form data in the HTTP request body, suitable for sensitive data without length limitations.
How do you handle errors in PHP?

Using try-catch blocks for exceptions, and set_error_handler function for custom error handling.
Intermediate PHP Questions:
What is the difference between include and require?

Both include files, but require will produce a fatal error and stop script execution if the file is missing, while include will only produce a warning.
Explain the concept of namespaces in PHP.

Namespaces allow you to group related classes, interfaces, functions, and constants together, avoiding name collisions and organizing code better.
What are the different types of errors in PHP?

Parse errors, Fatal errors, Warning errors, and Notice errors.
How can you secure your PHP application against SQL injection?

By using prepared statements and parameterized queries with PDO or MySQLi.
Advanced PHP Questions:
What is Composer and how do you use it in a PHP project?

Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. It allows you to declare libraries your project depends on and manages (installing/updating) them.
Describe the MVC architecture and how PHP can be used to implement it.

MVC (Model-View-Controller) separates the application logic into three components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (business logic). PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony follow the MVC architecture.
What is a PHP trait and when would you use it?

Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in PHP. A trait is similar to a class but is intended to group methods that can be used in multiple classes. You would use traits to avoid code duplication.
How do you handle file uploads in PHP?

By setting the formâ€™s enctype attribute to multipart/form-data, using the $_FILES superglobal to handle the uploaded file, and performing checks for file size, type, and errors.
Practical PHP Questions:
Write a function to connect to a MySQL database using PDO.

php
Copy code
function connectDB($host, $dbname, $user, $pass) {
    try {
        $dsn = "mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname";
        $options = [
            PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
            PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,
        ];
        $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass, $options);
        return $pdo;
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
        return null;
    }
}
How would you implement session management in PHP?

Using session_start() to begin a session and $_SESSION superglobal to store and retrieve session data. Ensure to manage session security through practices like regenerating session IDs and using secure cookies.
Behavioral Questions:
Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame difficulties.

Look for answers that demonstrate problem-solving skills, resilience, and the ability to work under pressure.
How do you stay updated with the latest developments in PHP and web development in general?

Candidates might mention following PHP news, participating in forums, attending webinars, or taking online courses.
Scenario-Based Questions:
How would you refactor a legacy PHP codebase to improve its performance and maintainability?

Look for steps like code review, applying design patterns, using modern PHP features, improving database queries, and adding automated tests.
Given a scenario where your PHP application is running slow, how would you troubleshoot and resolve the issue?

Steps might include profiling the application, identifying bottlenecks, optimizing database queries, caching, and optimizing code and server configuration.
